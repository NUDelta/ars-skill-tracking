# Skill Tracking + Development

This repo contains the conde for the DTR project **Skill Tracking + Development** under the ARS SIG. The children repos are:


## douglas-web

This repo contains the most recent code for the Douglas Web Sidebar. This sidebar is loaded into Google Sheets using an iFrame, which allows for quicker development using modern tools such as React and Express. This code was used during Spring 2018 for a status update on the entire class.

## douglas-slackbot
This repo contains the code used during Spring 2018 when we were trying to test whether help reminders through slack would make students more likely to reach out for help. 

## douglas-sidebar
The code for the Google Sheets add-on *Douglas Recommender*. This code is still used as the base behind the Sheets plugin.

## douglas-api
The *outdated* code that used to power the Douglas backend, and return helper recommendations based on the task a user inputs to the system.
